<p> Hello there! Welcome to My Gallery! Here you will see some of my work that have done.
    These piece are from different animes I enjoy watching. From watching these animes, I started to join
    other fans with creating OC (orignal characters). You will see some of mine own OCs from these shows.

        <p2> This is one of my early piece of art work when I started to do digital art.  I used whatever knowledge I have learned from school.
            I did have an idea of what I was doing when I did this piece, but I was having time trying to understand the body when drawing.
            This is my first OC I have created... Well, I should say the first OC I have drawn.  I had other OCs from another anime I was watching.
            But this anime, which is One Piece is one of my favorite anime to watch.
            Her name is Sunset and she was the OC that help me start my digital art journey.  Also, if the outfits looks familiar, it is from Winx Club's Bloom's season 1 outfits.

        <p2> If you are someone that likes or loves Pokémon, well I can help you with that. For this piece, someone I follow on Instagram hosted a small event to celebrate the final
            arc in the Pokémon franchise with Ash Ketchum as the main protagonist for over 25 seasons of the anime, and who happened to be become a &copy;Pokémon Master and the Monarch (World Champion) 
            at the end of Pokémon Journey.  For this small event, the host wanted people to created a team with our OCs from One Piece.  However, the host asked us to create the team
            with Pokémon that match with our OCs personality and if they had a Devil Fruit Power (Powers in One Piece they get from eatting these fruits). 
            I picked my OC Sunet, since she is one of my main OCs from the One Piece OCs I have.  When it came to this piece, I had to think about witch Pokémons made the most sense to her.
            When I started to think about it, two Pokémon came to mind witch was Flareon and Nine Tails because they are fire type and they go with her personality.  When you start a Pokémon
            game from any generation, you have to pick from three starter Pokémon. Fire, Water and Grass are the three types that you pick from.  For this, I knew that Sunset, would pick a Fire Type starter.
            I looked at the all the fire type from the franchise, the one that I picked was Scorbunny from generation 10. Scorbunny evolves to Raboot and evolves to Cinderace. For the other three Pokémon,
            the hosted wanted us to have at least one Mythical or Legendary Pokémon.  But, I picked one of each, one Mythical and one Legendary, and those two Pokémon were Dialga for the Legendary and Celebi for the
            Mythical since they match Sunset's Devil Fruit Power.  For the last one, I started to think about the new generation of Pokémon and we are introduce Paradox Pokémon from pass and future Pokémon.  For
            this I went with a future Paradox Pokémon, Iron Valiant (visual traits from both Gardevoir and Gallade) since this one is the newer Pokémon, and it is based off from the future.

        <p2> This is an action pose for my OC from My Hero Academia.  She has two name, her birth name is Karina Rizzo (Itailan Name) and her other name is Kokomo Takami (Japanese Name) is is half-Itailan and half-Japanese.
            But I mainly use her Japanese name Kokomo to make it easy is on people to read and for her story that I have for her in the My Hero Academia world.

        <p2> If you saw the first piece on this page.  Then, this piece of my work should look very simpler to you.  This is a redraw I did almost two years later from the first time I did.
            To do this re-draw, and to see how much I have change in just two years, it really suprised me.  I am very proud of this.  From anatomy of the body, the way I changed og how I shade and highlight.
            Plus having more movement in the hair as well. Still working on the hands and feets since they are hard to get down.

        <p2> This is was just a fun piece.  I wanted to do a happy birthday post for my twin OCs, Sunset and Zale.  They are born in June on the 7th and 8th.
            I just randomly picked out birthdays for my OCs.  Their birthday happened to fall when it was Pride Month.
