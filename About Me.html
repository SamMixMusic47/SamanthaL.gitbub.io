<h3> Get to know Me </h3>

 Hello there and Welcome to the About Me page!
 <br>
 <img src="Imgs Photoshop/AboutMe.JPG" alt=ImgsPhotoshop" style="width:250px;height:250px;">
 <br>
            <p1> The name is Samantha Loureiro. I'm currently a College Studnet at City Tech. I am a digital artist, and I mainly use the app Proceate. However, I do know some of the Adobe Programs.
                I have been drawing in Proceate since late Fall of 2021, while I had used Adobe since my high school days.  I did do some Animation but in my early college classes, mainly the 2D Animation.
                I enjoy drawing my OCs (orgianl charatcers) from anime I enjoy and fanart as well. Sometime, I like to take part in events that are hosted by fellow fans of animes I enjoy.
                With these event I grow better as an artist. 
            </p1>
            <br>

            <p1>I am also self-taught. I taught myself in Procreate and I started to draw with the knowledge I knew from my time in mu high school and BMCC.  I looked up many different videos from YouTube and the different SNS apps.
                I also looked at many of my follow colleagues work on Instagram.
                By teaching myself in Procreate, I can have a better understand on what the program is about and about the different brushes they have on there.  Also, Procreate just added a new app to thier line and that is 
                Procreate Dream.  Procreate Dream is new to everyone and it is for those who want to learn or those that now animtation.  I am new to this and it differet from Adobe After Affert.

            There are many more I can add to the list but it can go on forever. These are the ones that came to mind right away. We all have different styles from each other but, we call have fun
            with what we do. That is creating art work for our follower/supports and we all want to make sure we so our best and get better as artists. I could not have ask for better people to look up too.
            They even help me at some points and they are great.

            <p1>For the Adobe Programs, I know Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I do know Affert Effects, but I am still learning about it. I started to know about the program back in my sophomore of highschool. I join the
                Photoshop club since I need a club for Honor Society since I need to keep my grades up.  Thanks to Photoshop club, I was able to be introduce to adobe and wanted to know more about digital art. For Illustrator, I
                started to know about it back in my second semester in BMCC and within the thrid semester I was introduce to InDesign. In both other semesters was also introduce to Affert Affert.
